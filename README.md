## Overview

This program analyzes paw tracking data generated by CLARA to extract kinematic features and compute session level means for mice performing a skilled reaching task. 

## General Workflow

TESTERS: A sample Curator folder and MATLAB 3D folder can be found in the "Test Data" folder.

Note: At any time, the session may be saved using the File menu. This creates a file for each mouse in the kdaFiles folder within the specified output directory. Files will be named using the following naming convention: mouseID_status.kda

1) Create an Output directory. This is where program data (.kda) files, processed data structures (.json) files, excel files with session means, and trajectory plots will be saved.

2) Run kda.m in MATLAB. Make sure that the folder containing kda.m ("bioelectrics-kda") is the working directory.

3) Load raw data using the File menu. A previously saved kda file with status "Raw" may be loaded instead.

4) Extract kinematic features using the Analysis menu. If kinematic features have already been extracted for a mouse, the resulting kda file with status "KinematicsExtracted" may be loaded instead.

5) Export session means to an excel file using the Export menu.
