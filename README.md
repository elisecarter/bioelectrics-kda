## Overview

This program analyzes paw tracking data generated by CLARA to extract kinematic features and compute session level means for mice performing a skilled reaching task. 

## General Workflow

Note: At any time, the session may be saved using the File menu. This creates a file for each mouse in the kdaFiles folder within the specified output directory. The file name will utilize the following naming convention: mouseID_status.kda

1) Create an Output directory. This is where kda files, json files, excel files with session means, and trajectory plots will be saved.

2) Load raw data using the File menu. A previously saved kda file with status "Raw" may be loaded instead.

3) Extract kinematic features using the Analysis menu. If kinematic features have already been extracted for a mouse, the resulting kda file with status "KinematicsExtracted" may be loaded instead.

4) Export session means to an excel file using the Export menu.
